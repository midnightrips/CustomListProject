This file describes the details and functionality of the – operator overload. 
I want to include details such as “syntax”, “parameters”, “return type”, and an example of it being used, with the output

DEFINITION: subtracts one instance of a custom list class from another instance of a custom list class resulting in each item from the second list being removed from the first list.

		public static CustomList<T> operator -(CustomList<T> firstList, CustomList<T> secondList)

Parameters: CustomList<T> firstList, CustomList<T> secondList
		The lists whose items are to be compared to each other. secondList contains the items that, if existing in firstList, will have their first instance removed from firstList.

Returns: CustomList<T> newList
		The result of the - operator overload method. The list contains the items in firstList that were not removed by the - operator overload method.

Implements: firstList - secondList

EXAMPLE: The following example demonstrates the - Operator Overload method.

            CustomList<int> firstList = new();
            CustomList<int> secondList = new();
            CustomList<int> newList = new();

            firstList.Add(3);
            firstList.Add(2);
            firstList.Add(3);
            firstList.Add(4);
            firstList.Add(5);
            secondList.Add(1);
            secondList.Add(2);
            secondList.Add(3);

            for(int i = 0; i < firstList.Count; i++;)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(firstList.Items[i]);
            }
            
            for(int i = 0; i < secondList.Count; i++;)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(secondList.Items[i]);
            }

            newList = firstList - secondList;

            for(int i = 0; i < newList.Count; i++;)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(newList.Items[i]);
            }
